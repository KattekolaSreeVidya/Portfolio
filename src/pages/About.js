          <p>
            I am a master's IT student who also writes poetry. My academic journey
            has been focused on Full-Stack Development, and I am passionate about
            creating scalable, efficient applications. Alongside my technical work,
            I enjoy expressing my creativity through poetry, exploring themes of
            destiny, life, and the human experience.
